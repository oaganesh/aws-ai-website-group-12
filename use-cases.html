            <p>We strive to combine technology and business domain expertise to help our customers understand compliance risks in their supply chain. We needed a way to process compliance documents at scale. Our process is to read images and PDF documents with forms, tables, and free-form text and extract data of interest from within those documents. Amazon Textract's OCR technology enabled us to extract text from documents.</p>

            <p>“We provide legal professionals with insightful research and analytics to help them make informed decisions. Therefore, we are always looking for better ways to discover insights from legal documents. Thanks to Amazon Comprehend's automatic machine learning (ML), we can now build accurate custom entity recognition models without getting into the complexities associated with ML. The entities that we care about the most, such as judge and attorney, can be identified quickly from over 200 million documents at above 92% accuracy.”</p>

            <p>FINRA receives millions of documents with unstructured data to support investigative, examination, and compliance processes. Our investigators and examiners had to manually go through documents page by page or run very targeted searches to find what they needed. With Amazon Comprehend, we can quickly extract individuals and organization, match extracted entities to FINRA records, flag individual of interest, and detect similarities with other documents.”</p>

            <p>“Using Amazon Comprehend for PII redaction with our tokenization system not only helps us reach a larger set of our customers but also helps us overcome the shortcomings of rules-based PII detection which can result in false alarms or missed details. PII detection is critical for businesses and with the power of context-aware NLP models from Comprehend we can uphold the trust customers place in us with their information. Amazon is innovating in ways to help push our business forward by adding new features which are critical to our product suite."</p>
